## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r webscraping}
install.packages('rvest')
library('rvest')

#Specifying the url for desired website to be scraped
url <- 'http://www.imdb.com/search/title?count=25&release_date=2018,2018&title_type=action'

#Reading the HTML code from the website
webpage <- read_html(url)
#Using CSS selectors to scrap the rankings section
rank_data_html <- html_nodes(webpage,'.text-primary')

#Converting the ranking data to text
rank_data <- html_text(rank_data_html)
#Data-Preprocessing: Converting rankings to numerical
rank_data<-as.numeric(rank_data)

#Using CSS selectors to scrap the title section
title_data_html <- html_nodes(webpage,'.lister-item-header a')
rating_data_html <- html_nodes(webpage,'.ratings-imdb-rating strong')

frame <- data.frame(Rank=as.numeric(rank_data),Title=html_text(title_data_html),Rating=html_text(rating_data_html))

frame


```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
